# reverse-wasi

This experiment aims to implement a simple `POSIX` application compiled to`wasm32-wasi` in the browser, the application repo can be found [here](https://github.com/sespinosa/reverse).

The functionality is very simple, you pass a string via `stdin` and you get the string reversed in `stdout` the point of doing this is to test the **backpressure** and **streaming** capabilities of **wasm**.

## Work in progress
